# Purpose of the Document

This document provides the detailed software requirements for the Deka Secure RAG product. It serves as the single source of truth for understanding the system's functionalities, interfaces, and behavior. As enterprises increasingly adopt Generative AI (GenAI) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies, the need for robust security and data privacy solutions has become paramount. This SRS aims to ensure alignment between all stakeholders (Product, Development, QA, etc.) and to provide a clear baseline for the development and testing of Secure RAG.
