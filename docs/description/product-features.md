# Product Features

The main features of Deka Secure RAG include:

- **Core Functionality:** F5-powered data anonymization/de-anonymization engine that intercepts traffic, encrypts sensitive data using enterprise-controlled keys, and reverses the process for returning data.

  - OWASP Top 10 LLM Protection (e.g., Prompt Injection Protection).
  - OWASP Top 10 API Security (e.g., API Discovery, Rate Limiting, PII Detection).
  - OWASP Top 10 Web App Security (e.g., Advanced WAF, Bot Protection).
  - Secure Multi-Cloud Networking (e.g., IPsec/TLS tunneling, DDoS Protection).
  - LLM & Platform Integration: Native integration with Lintasarta DekaLLM and transparent compatibility with standard RAG orchestration frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex).

- **Packaging & Access:** Tiered subscription packages (Advance, AI-Enhanced, Ultimate Privacy) to cater to different security needs and scales.

- **Monitoring & Logging:** Robust logging of all security events detected by the F5 stack and performance monitoring of the anonymization process.
