## Charging

- The charging model for the Secure RAG product is based on a fixed Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) corresponding to the customer's selected subscription package (Advance, AI-Enhanced, or Ultimate Privacy).
- The Lintasarta DekaLLM service is responsible for tracking the total number of tokens consumed by the customer during the billing period.
- AI Service Portal will monitor the token consumption data provided by the DekaLLM service and compare it against the token allowance included in the customer's subscription package.
- The pricing structure for each subscription package is fixed and managed within the Service Portal and service agreement.
- Any updates to the pricing configuration will apply only to new or renewed subscription periods and will not affect active subscriptions.
- The total monthly charge is composed of the fixed MRC. If the included token allowance is exceeded, users would need to top up their LLM coin balance.

## Billing

- The billing process consolidates and manages the charges calculated during the charging phase. It involves the generation, distribution, and tracking of invoices to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability.
- All charges, including the fixed Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) and any applicable overage charges from token usage, are aggregated over a defined monthly billing period.
- Once all charges for the period are aggregated, the system will automatically generate a detailed invoice for the customer.
- Generated invoices will be made available to customers through the Service Portal, where they can be viewed and downloaded.
- The system will support multiple payment methods, such as Credit Card and Bank Transfer, to settle the invoice.
- Additionally, manual billing process will be managed by Lintasarta Sales & Finances.
